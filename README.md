# Algorithms and Analysis
 
    Feature of some Algorithms I learned and implemented when taking 
    Algorithms and Analysis during my Junior Year as an ISBA B.S. student
    at LMU. 

    The algos covered in these projects are: 

        - A* Search 
            - Pathfinding search algorithm 
        - Alpha Beta Pruning with Minimax 
            - Game tree optmization 
        - Minimum Edit Distance Dynamic Programming 
            - Comparison algo, DNA sequencing/typo recognition
        - Huffman Tree Compression & Decompression 
            - Efficent Data Compression and Decompression 
        - Arc Consistency Algorithm #3 
            - Constraint satisfaction problem algorithm
